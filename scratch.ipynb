      "Final Answer:\n",
      "\n",
      "To make a vanilla sponge cake, you will need the following ingredients:\n",
      "\n",
      "* 2 and 1/2 cups (310g) all-purpose flour\n",
      "* 2 cups (400g) granulated sugar\n",
      "* 1 cup (226g) unsalted butter, at room temperature\n",
      "* 1 cup (245ml) whole milk, at room temperature\n",
      "* 1 tablespoon + 1 teaspoon baking powder\n",
      "* 1/2 teaspoon salt\n",
      "* 1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract\n",
      "* 9 large eggs, separated\n",
      "\n",
      "Steps:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Preheat the oven to 350°F (180°C). Grease and flour two 9-inch round cake pans, or line them with parchment paper.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. In a medium bowl, whisk together the flour, baking powder, and salt. Set aside.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. In a large mixing bowl, beat the butter on medium speed until it's softened and creamy, about 2 minutes. Gradually add the sugar while continuing to beat on medium speed until the mixture is light and fluffy, about 5 minutes. Add in the vanilla extract.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. One at a time, beat in the egg yolks. Make sure each one is fully incorporated before adding the next. Scrape down the sides of the bowl after each addition.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. With the mixer on low speed, gradually add the flour mixture and alternately add the milk to the butter mixture, beginning and ending with the flour. Mix just until combined. Do not overmix.\n",
      "\n",
      "6. In a clean, large bowl, beat the egg whites using an electric mixer on high speed until they form stiff peaks. Fold one-third of the beaten egg whites into the batter to lighten it. Gently fold in the remaining egg whites. Be careful not to deflate the egg whites.\n",
      "\n",
      "7. Divide the batter evenly between the prepared pans, smoothing the tops with a spatula. Bake for 30-35 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center of the cakes comes out clean. Allow the cakes to cool completely in their pans on wire racks.\n",
      "\n",
      "8. Once the cakes have cooled, you can frost and decorate them as desired. Enjoy your homemade vanilla sponge cake!\u001b[0m\n",

In a medium bowl, whisk together flour, cocoa powder, baking powder, baking soda, and salt. In a large bowl, beat sugar and oil until combined, then add the egg and mix well. Stir in milk and vanilla extract. Gradually add the dry ingredients to the wet mixture, stirring until just combined. Slowly pour in boiling water and stir until the batter is smooth. Pour the batter into the prepared cake pan and bake for 30-35 minutes or until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean. Let the cake cool before serving. To ensure the best results, use fresh ingredients and follow the recipe's instructions carefully.\n"
